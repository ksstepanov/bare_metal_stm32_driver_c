/*
 * The nested vector interrupt controller NVIC includes the following features:
 * 52 maskable interrupt channels (not including the 16 interrupt lines of CortexÂ®-M4 with FPU)
 * 16 programmable priority levels (4 bits of interrupt priority are used)
 * low-latency exception and interrupt handling
 * power management control
 * implementation of system control registers
 * The NVIC and the processor core interface are closely coupled, which enables low latency
 * interrupt processing and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.
 * All interrupts including the core exceptions are managed by the NVIC. For more information
 * on exceptions and NVIC programming, refer to programming manual PM0214.
